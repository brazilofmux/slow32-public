# Feature: Basic Arithmetic

## Purpose
Ensures basic arithmetic operations continue to work correctly.

## Tests
- Addition (10 + 3 = 13)
- Subtraction (10 - 3 = 7)
- Multiplication (10 * 3 = 30)
- Division (10 / 3 = 3)
- Remainder (10 % 3 = 1)

## Expected
Should output "PASS" if all operations work correctly.
