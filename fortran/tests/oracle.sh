# Differential oracle: compile and run a fixed-form Fortran 77 program
# with gfortran in a container, and print exactly what it printed.
#
# Every compiler in this project is developed against a reference
# implementation -- LLVM for stage08, gforth for stage01.  This is F77's.
# The oracle runs NATIVE code; it is not a SLOW-32 emulator.  What is
# being compared is program output, not instructions.
#
# Usage:   ./oracle.sh prog.f [args...]
# Exit:    the program's own exit status (so STOP n is testable), or
#          2 when the oracle itself failed to compile the source.
#
# The container mounts only the source file's directory.  Podman on
# macOS runs in a VM that shares home paths but not /tmp, so sources
# must live somewhere under $HOME -- tests/ does.
