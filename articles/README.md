## Substack Integration Pattern

1. Publish the **story-first** article and link the docs repo
2. Pull short excerpts from **Programmer's Guide** and **Datasheet** into callout boxes (100â€“200 words each)
3. Include a 3-command **Try it** box pointing at `docs/10-quickstart.md` and `examples/hello-debug.s`

This keeps the article narrative-clean and moves the reference detail into the repo where it belongs.
