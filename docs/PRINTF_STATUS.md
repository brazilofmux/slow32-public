# Printf Implementation Status

## Current State
The printf implementation in SLOW-32 is functional but has output formatting issues when handling format specifiers.

## Test Results
```
Test 1: Simple string        ✅ Works correctly
Test 2: Number %d            ⚠️ Outputs garbled (shows ">>>>>>" patterns)
Test 3: %d + %d = %d         ⚠️ Outputs garbled
Test 4: Hex 0x%x             ⚠️ Outputs garbled  
Test 5: Final string         ✅ Works correctly
```

## Analysis
- Simple string printing (no format specifiers) works perfectly
- Format specifier handling causes garbled output that looks like repeated ">>>>" characters
- The program continues to execute and doesn't crash
- All tests complete successfully, just with corrupted output for formatted values

## Implementation Details
- Located in: `runtime/printf.c`
- Based on simplified TinyMUX sprintf code
- Supports: %d, %u, %x, %X, %s, %c format specifiers
- Uses putchar() for output (via DEBUG instruction)

## Requirements for a Sufficient Printf

### Must Have
1. **%d** - Signed decimal integers
2. **%u** - Unsigned decimal integers  
3. **%x/%X** - Hexadecimal (lower/upper case)
4. **%s** - String output
5. **%c** - Character output
6. **%%** - Literal percent sign

### Nice to Have
1. **%p** - Pointer output (as hex)
2. Field width specifiers (e.g., %8d)
3. Zero padding (e.g., %08x)

### Not Needed (for now)
1. Floating point (%f, %g, %e) - SLOW-32 doesn't support FP yet
2. Long long support (%lld) - Focus on 32-bit
3. Precision specifiers
4. Color codes
5. Complex formatting

## Recommendation
The current printf has the right structure but seems to have an issue with how it outputs formatted values. The garbled ">>>>>>" output suggests the DEBUG instruction might be outputting raw binary values instead of ASCII characters for the converted numbers.

Next step would be to check the integer-to-string conversion functions (utoa, itoa, utox) and ensure they're properly null-terminating and that putchar is being called with the right values.
