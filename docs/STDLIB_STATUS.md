# SLOW-32 Standard Library Status

## Overview
We've made significant progress expanding the SLOW-32 standard library with MMIO support. However, several limitations in the LLVM backend prevent full stdlib implementation.

## Completed Components

### String Library (string.h) - WORKING ✅
- `strlen` - PASS
- `strcpy` - PASS  
- `strncpy` - PASS
- `strcmp` - PASS
- `strncmp` - PASS
- `strcat` - PASS
- `strncat` - PASS
- `strchr` - PASS
- `strrchr` - PASS
- `strstr` - PASS
- `memset` - PASS
- `memcpy` - PASS
- `memmove` - FAIL (bug in implementation)
- `memcmp` - PASS
- `memchr` - PASS

### Math Library (math.h) - PARTIAL ⚠️
- Integer math functions created (math_int.c)
- Floating point functions written but untested due to soft-float overhead
- Avoided division operators due to backend limitations

### Memory Allocation (malloc.c) - UNTESTED ⚠️
- Basic heap allocator implemented
- Uses fixed heap at 0x00100000
- `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, `realloc` implemented
- Not yet assembled due to backend issues

### Standard Library Utils (stdlib_utils.c) - PARTIAL ⚠️
- `abs`, `labs` - implemented
- `atoi`, `atol` - implemented
- `rand`, `srand` - implemented (fixed overflow issue)
- `exit`, `abort` - implemented using MMIO
- `qsort`, `bsearch` - REMOVED (function pointers not supported)

### Standard I/O (stdio.c) - BLOCKED ❌
- Full implementation written with MMIO support
- Cannot compile due to missing UDIV in backend
- Includes file operations, printf family, etc.

## LLVM Backend Issues Blocking Progress

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing UDIV/SDIV Instructions**
   - Blocks: stdio.c compilation, division operations
   - Workaround: Avoided division in library code

2. **Function Pointer Calls Not Supported**
   - Blocks: qsort, bsearch, callbacks
   - Workaround: Removed these functions

3. **-O2 Optimization Hangs LLC**
   - Blocks: Optimized builds
   - Workaround: Using -O1

4. **No Inline Assembly Support in Clang Target**
   - Blocks: Direct use of HALT instruction
   - Note: asm("halt") won't work until we add inline asm support

## File Structure Created

└── test_stdlib.c    ✅ Working test suite
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes Needed in llvm-project:
1. Add UDIV/SDIV support in SLOW32ISelLowering.cpp
2. Implement indirect calls for function pointers
3. Debug -O2 optimization issue
4. Add inline assembly support to Clang target

### Library Improvements:
1. Fix memmove implementation bug
2. Test malloc/free once compiled
3. Add more comprehensive test coverage
4. Implement MMIO-based file I/O once stdio.c compiles

## Working Test Output
```
SLOW-32 Standard Library Test Suite
====================================
Testing string functions:
  strlen: PASS
  strcpy: PASS
  strcat: PASS
  strchr: PASS
  strstr: PASS
Testing memory functions:
  memset: PASS
  memcpy: PASS
  memmove: FAIL
  memchr: PASS
```

## Build Commands for Working Components
```bash
# Compile string library
~/llvm-project/build/bin/clang -target slow32-unknown-none -S -emit-llvm -O1 -Iinclude string.c -o string.ll
~/llvm-project/build/bin/llc -mtriple=slow32-unknown-none string.ll -o string.s
../assembler/slow32asm string.s string.s32o

# Link and run test
./linker/s32-ld -o test.s32x runtime/crt0.s32o test.s32o runtime/string.s32o runtime/stdlib.s32o runtime/intrinsics.s32o
./emulator/slow32 test.s32x
```

## Summary
We have a functional string library and test framework, but are blocked on further stdlib expansion by LLVM backend limitations. The MMIO infrastructure is ready for full stdio once division support is added.
