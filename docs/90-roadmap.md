# Roadmap

**Near-term**
- MMIO/TRAP definition and host shims
- Disassembler polish, objdump/exedump views

**Mid-term**
- Floating point: scalar encoding, calling convention, NaN/rounding
- Atomics/concurrency: minimal ops vs. host-mediated primitives
- SIMD exploration (64/128-bit lanes)
- Optional privileged/TRAP space
- JIT: explore QEMU Tiny Code Compiler
